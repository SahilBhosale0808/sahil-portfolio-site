           Here's a quick rundown of the Internet's history:

            <ul>
                <li><b>Web 1.0 is a read-only web</b> that allows individuals to view
                    information placed on websites.</li>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>2.0 is a read-write web</b> in which users may both read and

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Web 3.0 is a read-write-interact web</b>(driven by artificial
                        intelligence) in which individuals may read, write, and interact with
                        material on websites and applications, including 3D visuals.</li>

        <p>Now that you are up to speed about each part of the history of the internet,
            letâ€™s dive in a little deeper.</p>

        <b>What Exactly is Web 1.0?</b>

        <p>
            Web 1.0 was the name given to the first version of the internet. Consider the
            read-only or syntactic web to be Web 1.0. The majority of participants were
            content consumers, whereas the creators were mostly web developers who
            produced websites with the information given predominantly in text or visual
            format. Web 1.0 existed approximately between 1991 and 2004.
        </p>


        <p>The following were the key technologies that composed web 1.0:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML (HyperText Markup (HyperText Markup Language)</li>
                <li>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</li>
                <li>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Like I said earlier, the major goal of web 1.0 was to help people discover
            information. Significantly, since it was "read-only," online users could not
            freely communicate, therefore any debate took place offline.
        </p>

        <b>What Exactly is Web 2.0?</b>

        <p>
            Most of us have only seen the web in its present form, which is also known as
            Web 2.0, the interactive read-write web, and the social web. You don't have
            to be a developer to participate in the Web 2.0 creative process. Many
            applications are built in such a manner that anybody can create them.
            You have the ability to generate ideas and share them with the rest of the
            world. In Web 2.0, you can also upload a video and make it accessible for
            millions of people to view, engage with, and comment on. Web 2.0 apps
            include YouTube, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter, and other social
            media platforms.
        </p>
        <p> Web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript frameworks like
            ReactJs, AngularJs, VueJs, and others enable businesses to create new
            concepts that allow users to contribute more to the Social Web. As a
            consequence, since Web 2.0 is designed around people, developers just need
            to provide a method to empower and engage users.
        </p>



        <p>In Web 2.0, you have no control over your data or how it is kept. In reality,
            corporations regularly monitor and keep user data without their knowledge or
            consent. All of this data is owned and managed by the companies in charge of
            these platforms. Furthermore, when governments feel someone is expressing
            a viewpoint that opposes their propaganda, servers are routinely taken down
            or bank accounts are seized. Using centralized servers, governments may
        </p> easily intervene, control, or shut down programs.
        <p>
            Governments routinely meddle in banks because they, too, are digital and
            centralized. They may, however, suspend bank accounts or limit access to
            money during times of extreme volatility, excessive inflation, or other
            political upheavals. Many of these issues will be addressed by Web 3.0,
            which aims to fundamentally rethink how we build and interact with apps.
        </p>

        <b>What Exactly is Web 3.0?</b>

        <p>
            Web 3.0, as a Semantic Web or read-write-execute, is the age (starting in
            2010) that foreshadows the future of the web. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
            Machine Learning (ML) allow computers to evaluate data in the same
            manner that people do, allowing for the intelligent development and
            dissemination of useful information based on a user's individual
            requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although there are several major differences between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0,
            decentralization is at the core of both. Web 3.0 developers almost never build
            and deploy programs that operate on a single server or store data in a single
            database (usually hosted on and managed by a single cloud provider).
        </p>
        <p>  
            Web 3.0 applications, on the other hand, are based on blockchains, which are
            decentralized networks of many peer-to-peer nodes (servers), or a
            combination of the two. These applications are known as decentralized apps
            (DApps), and the word is often used in the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Participants
            in the network (developers) are rewarded for providing the best quality
            services to maintain a robust and secure decentralized network.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whereas web 2.0 was driven largely by the advent of mobile, social, and
            cloud technologies, web 3.0 is propelled by four additional layers of technical
            innovation:
            Edge computing
            Decentralization
            Artificial intelligence & machine learning
            Blockchain
        </p>
