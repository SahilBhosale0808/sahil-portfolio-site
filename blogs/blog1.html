            <h1>Upgrade from Windows 7 / 8.1 to 11 (Not Recommended)</h1>

            <p>If you are using Windows 7 or 8.1, you can still upgrade to Windows 11, but it is difficult. The reason is that the support for Windows 7 no more exists while the support for Windows 8.1 ended in 2018. That is why they will not receive feature updates to Windows 11. But you can do a clean install of Windows 11.</p>

            <p>But, it comes with a drawback. Performing a clean install erases all data on your machine. Hence, you must back up all your data before installing Windows 11. And after the installation, you can restore data from the backup.</p>

            <p>There are many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+update+windows+7+and+windows+8.1+to+windows+10">Youtube Videos</a> on how to do it. You can follow those on your own risk. </p>

            <h3>That is all about freely upgrading to Windows 11. I am highly impressed by the design and look and feel of Windows 11.</h3>
            <h3>That said, Windows 11 claims to be one of the best operating systems in the history of operating systems by Microsoft. As it offers the improved Microsoft Store, better support for Android apps, and more features.</h3>
